# Working with data {#working-with-data}

In many biological projects where large amounts of data from e.g. sequencing are involved, the
project can be divided up into three phases: "annotation", analyses and preparation of final
figures. The quotes around annotation signifies that the term should be understood in a very wide
sense as any kind of processing required before raw data can be turned into a format useful for
the true biological analysis, usually tables but also e.g. sequence files or phylogenies.

![**Overall workflow in computational biology.** The yellow boxes indicates parts that are useful to keep under version control, e.g. Git. The manuscript is common to keep under a different kind of source control, i.e. the "tracked changes" functionality in word processors.](img/computational_workflow.png)

## Using the Linux command line {#linux-cli}

The Linux command line is a program called the *shell*, and exists in different versions. The most
popular is probably `bash` (short for *B*ourne *a*gain *sh*ell) a derivative of the original *Bourne
shell* `sh`. Together with *Korn shell*, `sh` and `bash` forms a family with similar syntax. A
second family started with *C shell* `csh`, which aimed at being more similar in syntax to the *C*
programming language. In this book, we're going to focus solely on `bash`.

The shell is both a way of interacting interactively with the computer and a programming language, a
*scripting* language. When you use the shell interactively you execute commands and programs and a
shell script is nothing else than a set of commands saved for later, though often generalized with
variables etc. to be more useful.
